        If we want a reliable supply we would want the refuge group's

        There is a chance 600 TAF of water will be delivered to this group. The
        darker colors, however, indicate that it's more likely that slightly
        less than 600 TAF of water will be delivered â€” around 500 TAF. As we'll
        later see, this is not a lot compared to other areas of California.

        At a glance, we can easily see that scenario 0020 appears to be the best
        scenario since the darker water levels reach higher than those of the
        other scenarios. To more concretely compare these scenarios, however,
        we'll use a different view.

        So why don't we just choose the best scenario? Well, it's because it's
